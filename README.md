# Customer Banking

## To access my Module 3 Challenge submission:

* Open your Git Bash or Terminal, and navigate to the directory in which you want to clone my GitHub repository (repo) to your computer by using the command (excluding quotation marks) "cd". For example, "cd ~/Desktop".

* Type in "git clone &lt;GitHub URL&gt;"

* Paste my GitHub URL: https://github.com/ishakgunacar/customer_banking.git in place of &lt;GitHub URL&gt; and hit enter. The repo folder should now be cloned to your system. 

* Navigate to the repo directory by typing "cd customer_banking".

* Type in "ls", there should be six files: a README, Account.py, cd_account.py, savings_account.py, customer_banking.py, and menu.py.

* Open the relevant files by typing in "explorer Account.py" if you're on Windows, or "open Account.py" if you're on Mac, and that should open up the case study via your desired Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Do this for the remainder of the relevant files: cd_account.py, savings_account.py, and customer_banking.py.

* You're all set! Please don't grade me so hard! :-)
